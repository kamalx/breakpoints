A simple css system to manage breakpoints and media queries on front-end
projects. The `breakpoints.css` file serves as a reference as well as valid
code to insert media queries. In this project, this is used as reference and
basic css trickery to present on-screen documentation if relevant class is
applied to the `html` element.
